# CodePlex Archive Archive
With Microsoft pulling the plug on CodePlex in favor of GitHub after their acquiral, what was left was the CodePlex Archive. This lasted 3 years. Now it's 2021, and Microsoft is about to pull the plug on the CodePlex archive. This repository will contain hopefully all of CodePlex's uploaded works.

## Microsoft's message
CodePlex Archive will be shut down after July 1st, 2021.

CodePlex was Microsoft's free, open source project hosting site, which ran from 2006 through 2017. The site has been in archive mode for 3 years. We now encourage customers to use [Github](https://github.con) for their open source project hosting needs.

CodePlex will continue as an archive until next July (2021), at which point it will be shut down. Until then, you can browse published projects, documentation, issues, and discussions which were posted before the site went into archive mode three years ago.

For questions or comments please contact [CodePlex Archive support](codeplexarchive@microsoft.com).
